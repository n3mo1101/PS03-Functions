Create a GitHub repository for this project, giving it a suitable name. Within the repository, establish a single project solution containing multiple console applications. Each console app should correspond to a specific number from the practice sets.

1. (Complete) Create a function that computes the area of a triangle using Heron’s formula:
            Area = √s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)
            where s is half the perimeter, or (a + b + c)/2

2. (Complete) Create a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
